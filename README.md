# Coding Guidelines
Standards, guidelines, and best practice we follow whilst developing at [We Make Websites](https://wemakewebsites.com/) on our Frame framework.

## Table of contents

1. [HTML](html/README.md)
1. [Liquid](liquid/README.md)
1. [CSS/SCSS](css/README.md)
1. [Javascript](https://github.com/Shopify/javascript#import-javascript-from-shopify)

## Why do we need guidelines?

When working on large, long-running projects, with dozens of developers of differing specialities and abilities, it is important that we all work in a unified way in order to:

* Keep the code base maintainable
* Keep code transparent, sane, and readable
* Keep the code base scalable
* Maintain the code base's performance

## Can I contribute to the guidelines?

Please branch from `master` and submit a pull request for any suggested changes.
